<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">QUIC <a href="#I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol">[I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol]</a> provides a multiplexed transport for HTTP <a href="#RFC7230">[RFC7230]</a> semantics that provides several key advantages over HTTP/1.1 <a href="#RFC7230">[RFC7230]</a> or HTTP/2 <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a> over TCP <a href="#RFC0793">[RFC0793]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document describes how QUIC can be secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.3 <a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-tls13">[I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]</a>.  TLS 1.3 provides critical latency improvements for connection establishment over previous versions.  Absent packet loss, most new connections can be established and secured within a single round trip; on subsequent connections between the same client and server, the client can often send application data immediately, that is, zero round trip setup.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document describes how the standardized TLS 1.3 can act a security component of QUIC.  The same design could work for TLS 1.2, though few of the benefits QUIC provides would be realized due to the handshake latency in versions of TLS prior to 1.3.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#notational-conventions" id="notational-conventions">Notational Conventions</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The words &#8220;MUST&#8221;, &#8220;MUST NOT&#8221;, &#8220;SHOULD&#8221;, and &#8220;MAY&#8221; are used in this document.  It&#8217;s not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning defined in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">QUIC <a href="#I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol">[I-D.tsvwg-quic-protocol]</a> can be separated into several modules:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>The basic frame envelope describes the common packet layout.  This layer includes connection identification, version negotiation, and includes markers that allow the framing and public reset to be identified.</li>
  <li>The public reset is an unprotected packet that allows an intermediary (an entity that is not part of the security context) to request the termination of a QUIC connection.</li>
  <li>Version negotiation frames are used to agree on a common version of QUIC to use.</li>
  <li>Framing comprises most of the QUIC protocol.  Framing provides a number of different types of frame, each with a specific purpose.  Framing supports frames for both congestion management and stream multiplexing.  Framing additionally provides a liveness testing capability (the PING frame).</li>
  <li>Encryption provides confidentiality and integrity protection for frames.  All frames are protected based on keying material derived from the TLS connection running on stream 1.  Prior to this, data is protected with the 0-RTT keys.</li>
  <li>Multiplexed streams are the primary payload of QUIC.  These provide reliable, in-order delivery of data and are used to carry the encryption handshake and transport parameters (stream 1), HTTP header fields (stream 3), and HTTP requests and responses.  Frames for managing multiplexing include those for creating and destroying streams as well as flow control and priority frames.</li>
  <li>Congestion management includes packet acknowledgment and other signal required to ensure effective use of available link capacity.</li>
  <li>A complete TLS connection is run on stream 1.  This includes the entire TLS record layer.  As the TLS connection reaches certain states, keying material is provided to the QUIC encryption layer for protecting the remainder of the QUIC traffic.</li>
  <li>HTTP mapping provides an adaptation to HTTP that is based on HTTP/2.</li>
</ol>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">TLS 1.3 provides two basic handshake modes of interest to QUIC:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>A full handshake in which the client is able to send application data after one round trip and the server immediately after receiving the first message from the client.</li>
  <li>A 0-RTT handshake in which the client uses information about the server to send immediately.  This data can be replayed by an attacker so it MUST NOT carry a self-contained trigger for any non-idempotent action.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.4">Two additional variations on this basic handshake exchange are relevant to this document:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The server can respond to a ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest, which adds an additional round trip prior to the basic exchange.  This is needed if the server wishes to request a different key exchange key from the client.  HelloRetryRequest is also used to verify that the client is correctly able to receive packets on the address it claims to have (see <a href="#source-address">Section 6.3</a>).</li>
  <li>A pre-shared key mode can be used for subsequent handshakes to avoid public key operations.  This is the basis for 0-RTT data, even if the remainder of the connection is protected by a new Diffie-Hellman exchange.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">QUIC completes its cryptographic handshake on stream 1, which means that the negotiation of keying material happens after the QUIC protocol has started.  This simplifies the use of TLS since QUIC is able to ensure that the TLS handshake packets are delivered reliably and in order.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">Prior to the completion of the TLS handshake, QUIC frames can be exchanged.  However, these frames are not authenticated or confidentiality protected.  <a href="#pre-handshake">Section 5</a> covers some of the implications of this design and limitations on QUIC operation during this phase.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">The transition to use of a new QUIC key occurs immediately after sending the TLS handshake messages that produced the key transition.  Every time that a new set of keys is used for protecting outbound messages, the KEY_PHASE bit in the public flags is toggled.  The KEY_PHASE bit on unencrypted messages is 0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">The KEY_PHASE bit on the public flags is the most significant bit (0x80).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">The KEY_PHASE bit allows a recipient to detect a change in keying material without needing to receive the message that triggers the change.  This avoids head-of-line blocking around transitions between keys without relying on trial decryption.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">The following transitions are defined:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The client transitions to using 0-RTT keys after sending the ClientHello.  This causes the KEY_PHASE bit on packets sent by the client to be set to 1.</li>
  <li>The server sends messages in the clear until the TLS handshake completes.  The KEY_PHASE bit on packets sent by the server is set to 0 when the handshake is in progress.  TLS handshake messages will still be protected by TLS record protection based on the TLS handshake traffic keys.</li>
  <li>The server transitions to using 1-RTT keys after sending its Finished message.  This causes the KEY_PHASE bit on packets sent by the server to be set to 1.</li>
  <li>The client transitions to 1-RTT keys after sending its Finished message.  Subsequent messages from the client will then have a KEY_PHASE of 0 if 0-RTT data was sent, and 1 otherwise.</li>
  <li>Both peers start sending messages protected by a new key immediately after sending a TLS KeyUpdate message. The value of the KEY_PHASE bit is changed each time.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.6">At each point, both keying material (see <a href="#key-expansion">Section 4.2</a>) and the AEAD function used by TLS is interchanged with the values that are currently in use for protecting outbound packets.  Once a change of keys has been made, packets with higher sequence numbers MUST use the new keying material until a newer set of keys (and AEAD) are used.  The exception to this is that retransmissions of TLS handshake packets MUST use the keys that they were originally protected with.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.7">Once a packet protected by a new key has been received, a recipient SHOULD retain the previous keys for a short period.  Retaining old keys allows the recipient to decode reordered packets around a change in keys.  Keys SHOULD be discarded when an endpoints has received all packets with sequence numbers lower than the lowest sequence number used for the new key, or when it determines that reordering of those packets is unlikely.  0-RTT keys SHOULD be retained until the handshake is complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.8">The KEY_PHASE bit does not directly indicate which keys are in use; it is used to mark transitions from one key to the next.  If a client does not attempt 0-RTT, then packets protected with the same keys will have the same KEY_PHASE bit; if the client attempts 0-RTT, then packets protected with the same keys will be marked with different KEY_PHASE values.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">A client would be unable to decrypt retransmissions of a server&#8217;s handshake messages that are protected using the 1-RTT keys, since the calculation of the application data keys depends on the contents of the handshake messages.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.3">This restriction means the creation of an exception to the requirement to always use new keys for sending once they are available.  A server MUST mark the retransmitted handshake messages with the same KEY_PHASE as the original messages to allow a recipient to distinguish the messages.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.4.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.2">4.1.2.</a> <a href="#key-update" id="key-update">Key Update</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">Once the TLS handshake is complete, the KEY_PHASE bit allows for the processing of messages without having to receive the TLS KeyUpdate message that triggers the key update.  This allows endpoints to start using updated keys immediately without the concern that a lost KeyUpdate will cause their messages to be indecipherable to their peer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.2">An endpoint MUST NOT initiate more than one key update at a time.  A new key update cannot be sent until the endpoint has received a matching KeyUpdate message from its peer; or, if the endpoint did not initiate the original key update, it has received an acknowledgment of its own KeyUpdate.</p>

QUIC does not assume a reliable transport and is therefore required to handle attacks where packets are dropped in other ways.

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.4.p.3">Since only TLS handshake packets and acknowledgments are sent in the clear, an attacker is able to force implementations to rely on retransmission for packets that are lost or shadowed.

<h2 id="rfc.section.5.2"><a href="#rfc.section.5.2">5.2.</a> <a href="#using-early-data" id="using-early-data">Use of 0-RTT Keys</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.1">If 0-RTT keys are available, the lack of replay protection means that restrictions on their use are necessary to avoid replay attacks on the protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.2">A client MUST only use 0-RTT keys to protect data that is idempotent.  A client MAY wish to apply additional restrictions on what data it sends prior to the completion of the TLS handshake.  A client otherwise treats 0-RTT keys as equivalent to 1-RTT keys.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.3">A client that receives an indication that its 0-RTT data has been accepted by a server can send 0-RTT data until it receives all of the server&#8217;s handshake messages.  A client SHOULD stop sending 0-RTT data if it receives an indication that 0-RTT data has been rejected.  In addition to a ServerHello without an early_data extension, an unprotected handshake message with a KEY_PHASE bit set to 0 indicates that 0-RTT data has been rejected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.4">A client SHOULD send its end_of_early_data alert only after it has received all of the server&#8217;s handshake messages.  Alternatively phrased, a client is encouraged to use 0-RTT keys until 1-RTT keys become available.  This prevents stalling of the connection and allows the client to send continuously.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.5">A server MUST NOT use 0-RTT keys to protect anything other than TLS handshake messages.  Servers therefore treat packets protected with 0-RTT keys as equivalent to unprotected packets in determining what is permissible to send.  A server protects handshake messages using the 0-RTT key if it decides to accept a 0-RTT key.  A server MUST still include the early_data extension in its ServerHello message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.p.6">This restriction prevents a server from responding to a request using frames protected by the 0-RTT keys.  This ensures that all application data from the server are always protected with keys that have forward secrecy.  However, this results in head-of-line blocking at the client because server responses cannot be decrypted until all the server&#8217;s handshake messages are received by the client.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.5.3"><a href="#rfc.section.5.3">5.3.</a> <a href="#pre-handshake-protected" id="pre-handshake-protected">Protected Frames Prior to Handshake Completion</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.1">Due to reordering and loss, protected packets might be received by an endpoint before the final handshake messages are received.  If these can be decrypted successfully, such packets MAY be stored and used once the handshake is complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.2">Unless expressly permitted below, encrypted packets MUST NOT be used prior to completing the TLS handshake, in particular the receipt of a valid Finished message and any authentication of the peer.  If packets are processed prior to completion of the handshake, an attacker might use the willingness of an implementation to use these packets to mount attacks.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.3">TLS handshake messages are covered by record protection during the handshake, once key agreement has completed.  This means that protected messages need to be decrypted to determine if they are TLS handshake messages or not.  Similarly, <samp>ACK</samp> and <samp>WINDOW_UPDATE</samp> frames might be needed to successfully complete the TLS handshake.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.4">Any timestamps present in <samp>ACK</samp> frames MUST be ignored rather than causing a fatal error.  Timestamps on protected frames MAY be saved and used once the TLS handshake completes successfully.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.3.p.5">An endpoint MAY save the last protected <samp>WINDOW_UPDATE</samp> frame it receives for each stream and apply the values once the TLS handshake completes.  Failing to do this might result in temporary stalling of affected streams.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.6"><a href="#rfc.section.6">6.</a> <a href="#quic-specific-additions-to-the-tls-handshake" id="quic-specific-additions-to-the-tls-handshake">QUIC-Specific Additions to the TLS Handshake</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.1">QUIC uses the TLS handshake for more than just negotiation of cryptographic parameters.  The TLS handshake validates protocol version selection, provides preliminary values for QUIC transport parameters, and allows a server to perform return routeability checks on clients.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.6.1">6.1.</a> <a href="#version-negotiation" id="version-negotiation">Protocol and Version Negotiation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.1">The QUIC version negotiation mechanism is used to negotiate the version of QUIC that is used prior to the completion of the handshake.  However, this packet is not authenticated, enabling an active attacker to force a version downgrade.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.2">To ensure that a QUIC version downgrade is not forced by an attacker, version information is copied into the TLS handshake, which provides integrity protection for the QUIC negotiation.  This does not prevent version downgrade during the handshake, though it means that such a downgrade causes a handshake failure.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.3">Protocols that use the QUIC transport MUST use Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) <a href="#RFC7301">[RFC7301]</a>.  The ALPN identifier for the protocol MUST be specific to the QUIC version that it operates over.  When constructing a ClientHello, clients MUST include a list of all the ALPN identifiers that they support, regardless of whether the QUIC version that they have currently selected supports that protocol.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.1.p.4">Servers SHOULD select an application protocol based solely on the information in the ClientHello, not using the QUIC version that the client has selected.  If the protocol that is selected is not supported with the QUIC version that is in use, the server MUST either send a QUIC version negotiation packet if this is possible, or fail the connection otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.2"><a href="#rfc.section.6.2">6.2.</a> <a href="#quic_parameters" id="quic_parameters">QUIC Extension</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">QUIC defines an extension for use with TLS.  That extension defines transport-related parameters.  This provides integrity protection for these values.  Including these in the TLS handshake also make the values that a client sets available to a server one-round trip earlier than parameters that are carried in QUIC frames.  This document does not define that extension.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.3"><a href="#rfc.section.6.3">6.3.</a> <a href="#source-address" id="source-address">Source Address Validation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.1">QUIC implementations describe a source address token.  This is an opaque blob that a server might provide to clients when they first use a given source address.  The client returns this token in subsequent messages as a return routeability check.  That is, the client returns this token to prove that it is able to receive packets at the source address that it claims.  This prevents the server from being used in packet reflection attacks (see <a href="#reflection">Section 7.1</a>).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.2">A source address token is opaque and consumed only by the server.  Therefore it can be included in the TLS 1.3 pre-shared key identifier for 0-RTT handshakes.  Servers that use 0-RTT are advised to provide new pre-shared key identifiers after every handshake to avoid linkability of connections by passive observers.  Clients MUST use a new pre-shared key identifier for every connection that they initiate; if no pre-shared key identifier is available, then resumption is not possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.3.p.3">A server that is under load might include a source address token in the cookie extension of a HelloRetryRequest. (Note: the current version of TLS 1.3 does not include the ability to include a cookie in HelloRetryRequest.)</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.6.4"><a href="#rfc.section.6.4">6.4.</a> <a href="#priming-0-rtt" id="priming-0-rtt">Priming 0-RTT</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.1">QUIC uses TLS without modification.  Therefore, it is possible to use a pre-shared key that was obtained in a TLS connection over TCP to enable 0-RTT in QUIC.  Similarly, QUIC can provide a pre-shared key that can be used to enable 0-RTT in TCP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.2">All the restrictions on the use of 0-RTT apply, and the certificate MUST be considered valid for both connections, which will use different protocol stacks and could use different port numbers.  For instance, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 operate over TLS and TCP, whereas QUIC operates over UDP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.p.3">Source address validation is not completely portable between different protocol stacks.  Even if the source IP address remains constant, the port number is likely to be different.  Packet reflection attacks are still possible in this situation, though the set of hosts that can initiate these attacks is greatly reduced.  A server might choose to avoid source address validation for such a connection, or allow an increase to the amount of data that it sends toward the client without source validation.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7"><a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> <a href="#security-considerations" id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">There are likely to be some real clangers here eventually, but the current set of issues is well captured in the relevant sections of the main text.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Never assume that because it isn&#8217;t in the security considerations section it doesn&#8217;t affect security.  Most of this document does.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.7.1"><a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#reflection" id="reflection">Packet Reflection Attack Mitigation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">A small ClientHello that results in a large block of handshake messages from a server can be used in packet reflection attacks to amplify the traffic generated by an attacker.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">Certificate caching <a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info">[I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info]</a> can reduce the size of the server&#8217;s handshake messages significantly.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">A client SHOULD also pad <a href="#RFC7685">[RFC7685]</a> its ClientHello to at least 1024 octets (TODO: tune this value).  A server is less likely to generate a packet reflection attack if the data it sends is a small multiple of the data it receives.  A server SHOULD use a HelloRetryRequest if the size of the handshake messages it sends is likely to exceed the size of the ClientHello.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.7.2"><a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> <a href="#useless" id="useless">Peer Denial of Service</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">QUIC, TLS and HTTP/2 all contain a messages that have legitimate uses in some contexts, but that can be abused to cause a peer to expend processing resources without having any observable impact on the state of the connection.  If processing is disproportionately large in comparison to the observable effects on bandwidth or state, then this could allow a malicious peer to exhaust processing capacity without consequence.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.2">QUIC prohibits the sending of empty <samp>STREAM</samp> frames unless they are marked with the FIN bit.  This prevents <samp>STREAM</samp> frames from being sent that only waste effort.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.3">TLS records SHOULD always contain at least one octet of a handshake messages or alert.  Records containing only padding are permitted during the handshake, but an excessive number might be used to generate unnecessary work.  Once the TLS handshake is complete, endpoints SHOULD NOT send TLS application data records unless it is to hide the length of QUIC records.  QUIC packet protection does not include any allowance for padding; padded TLS application data records can be used to mask the length of QUIC frames.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.4">While there are legitimate uses for some redundant packets, implementations SHOULD track redundant packets and treat excessive volumes of any non-productive packets as indicative of an attack.</p>
